Two key components in creating effective language-based AI agents are interactivity and environment grounding, shown to be vital parts of language learning in humans, and posit that interactive narratives should be the environments of choice for training such agents. These games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world through natural language—”perceiving’’, “acting upon’’, and “talking to’’ the world using textual descriptions, commands, and dialogue—and as such exist at the intersection of natural language processing, storytelling, and sequential decision making.
